## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It has been quite a while since I did one of these challenges, so my main goal was to reacquaint myself with the workflow, remember how to set up GitHub Pages and things like that. It was more challenging than I expected, and I had to unearth some knowledge about various things like how to create links using markdown and take a screenshot in Firefox.

### Continued development

I plan to finish some CSS Grid projects before attempting some JavaScript projects.
